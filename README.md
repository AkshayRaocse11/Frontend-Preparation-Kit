# Frontend Interview Preparation Kit 🚀

A **structured, interview-focused preparation repository** for Frontend / JavaScript / React coding rounds.

This repo is a **work-in-progress** and is actively updated as I practice and solve problems.  
The goal is **depth, clarity, and interview readiness** — not just completion.

---

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

- Prepare for **Frontend coding interviews (Mid → Senior level)**
- Master **JavaScript problem solving**
- Build **React machine coding components from scratch**
- Practice **thinking out loud, edge cases, and performance awareness**
- Maintain a **single source of truth** for interview revision

---

## ✅ Progress Status (Honest)

- ✔️ Some problems are **completed**
- 🛠️ Many problems are **in progress**
- ⏳ Remaining problems are **planned**

> ⚠️ This repo is **NOT fully completed yet** — and that is intentional.  
> I am focusing on **quality over speed**.
